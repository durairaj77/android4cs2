\subsection{Missing R.java}

ERROR: Unable to open class file \/...\/workspace\/DieRoller\/gen\/com\/googlecode\/android4cs2\/dieroller\/R.java: No such file or directory

Ok, just Run the project and it will be created.

\subsection{Missing /gen directory}

Clean the Project. Project -> Clean

\subsection{Fatal Java Error}

A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment.

This is because you are trying to run the project as a Java application,
not an Android application. Caused by having main method in other files, 
running them instead of main Activity file. 
Wipe and reset your Launch properties,
make sure you are choosing Android Project.
